# Jenkins Discord Bot
This repo contains a simple bot that sends a message to the 'general' channel about the status of the last build.

The bot is using the information send by the [Notification plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Notification+Plugin). It also use [Resitfy](http://restify.com/) to handle the POST request of Jenkins.
